# weather-journal-web-app

## Overview
This project required me to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## The following tasks were completed in this project:
* Setup the Node.js environment.
* Added the express, body-parser, and cors modules to Node.
* Ran the local server and printed out logs to the Command Line.
* Created API credentials on OpenWeatherMap.com.
* The personal API key is stored in a const variable.
* Data is successfully received from the weather API.
* Implemented GET and POST routes on both the client and the server.
* Dynamically display app data.
* Add event listener to the form button using JS.
