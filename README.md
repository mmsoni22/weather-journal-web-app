# weather-journal-web-app

## Overview
This project required me to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## The following tasks were completed in this project:
* Setup the Node.js environment.

## Done
What was done? I enhanced the server.js with two endpoints and required middleware to enable body-parser and cors.

In website/app.js I created several functions for fetching weather data from OpenWeatherAPI, saving the data through the post request and updating the UI dynamically.

Try it out!
